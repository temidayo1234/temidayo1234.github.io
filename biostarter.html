      <p>I am a Data Analyst who has an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering, and will soon hold a Certificate in Data Analytics and Visualization from Johns Hopkins University. I am equipped with various technical skills such as Tableau, Python, and SQL among others. I am also a great team player who enjoys collaborating, communicating effectively, and listening closely. I have worked in a Federal Government capacity over the past eight years including two as an intern. On multiple occasions, I have analyzed data for various government systems and applications and presented my findings to appropriate stakeholders to aid in making sound and fiscally responsible decisions. I am a fast learner and great team member.
